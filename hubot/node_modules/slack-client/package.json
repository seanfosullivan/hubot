  "readme": "# Node.js Slack Client Library\n\n## node-slack v2.0.0 please read!\n\nHi all,\n\nFirst of all, thanks for using this library :) We really appreciate all the developers out there who want to integrate with Slack and build cool bots and tools.\n\nI've been working on a substantial refactor of the existing node-client library for the past little while and it's now at the point where getting your feedback would be fantastic.\n\nThat refactor is located on [my personal github](https://github.com/l12s/node-slack-client).\n\nThe refactor has 3 main goals:\n- get node-slack to a point where it can be easily maintained and extended, both by Slack and our delightful external contributors:\n  - improve test coverage\n  - standardize code; e.g. move off coffee script, make heavier use of npm modules etc.\n  - update JSDoc, code comments and inline documentation\n- address flaws in the existing client, e.g.\n  - improve reconnection logic\n  - respect 429 headers\n  - improve the client so that it can be used as the foundation for more complex apps and use cases, e.g. design to support different types of datastores\n- add documentation, examples and test apps\n\nThere are still some issues outstanding on the refactor, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/l12s/node-slack-client/issues)\n\nWhat would be great to get some help on is:\n- code review; please check out the code and raise any issues you run into\n- test it out; it would be great to get a few test applications written to shake out any bugs, or if you have an app already to see\n\n## Travis-CI Build Status\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slackhq/node-slack-client.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/slackhq/node-slack-client)\n\n## Description\n\nThis is a Slack client library for Node.js. It's intended to expose all of the functionality of [Slack's Real Time Messaging API](https://api.slack.com/rtm) while providing some common abstractions and generally making your life easier, if you want it to.\n\nThis code has been built to support our [hubot-slack](https://github.com/slackhq/hubot-slack) adapter. Most other functionality isn't yet supported, and documentation is minimal, at best.\n\n## Installation\n```bash\nnpm install slack-client --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n```coffeescript\nSlack = require 'slack-client'\n\nslackToken = 'xoxb-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE' # Add a bot at https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot and copy the token here.\nautoReconnect = true # Automatically reconnect after an error response from Slack.\nautoMark = true # Automatically mark each message as read after it is processed.\n\nslack = new Slack(slackToken, autoReconnect, autoMark)\n\nslack.on 'open', ->\n    console.log \"Connected to #{slack.team.name} as @#{slack.self.name}\"\n\nslack.on 'message', (message) ->\n    console.log message\n\nslack.on 'error', (err) ->\n    console.error \"Error\", err\n\nslack.login()\n\n```\n\nA full example of how to use this module from Node.js can be found in the [/examples directory](https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client/tree/master/examples).\n\n## Contribute\n\nHere's the most direct way to get your work merged into the project.\n\n1. Fork the project\n2. Clone down your fork\n3. Create a feature branch\n4. Hack away and add tests, not necessarily in that order\n5. Make sure everything still passes by running tests\n6. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks without errors\n7. Add yourself to package.json as a contributor\n8. Push the branch up to your fork\n9. Send a pull request for your branch\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright &copy; Slack Technologies, Inc. MIT License; see LICENSE for further details.\n\n## TODOs\n\n1. Better/any timeouts on initial websocket connection\n2. Better/any timeouts on API calls\n3. Document the connection options, etc\n4. Emit more events around unreads and mentions\n",
